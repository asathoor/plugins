# Per's Music Taxonomy

Taxonomies are an attempt to create order on your web page. 
Music and the plethora of genres and subgenres is a good example.

## How to use this plugin

Upload the files music-taxonomy.php and index.php  to your domain host.
Alternatively you can zip them and upload the zip via your Dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

Q: When I add the genres to the menu I get an error page.  
A: Try this:

* Go to Dashboard / Settings / Permalinks
* Don't change anything here. Just click "Save Changes"
* Clear the server cache (I use WP Super Cache)
* Clear your browser's cache
* Reload the web page
