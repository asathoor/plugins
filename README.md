# A Few WordPress Plugins

Here are a few plugins used in Multimedia Desiger classes,  and on my website [Multimusen.dk](https://multimusen.dk/)

## petj-Taxonomies

Hierarchical taxonomies for WordPress. Probably you'll adapt it to your site, and add a more suitable headline than taxonomies. For instance music genres, languages etc.

*Case:* For instance my website [Multimusen.dk](https://multimusen.dk/) has posts in Danish and English. I use taxonomies in order to separate Danish and English content.

## Custom post types

Experimental: editor in the dashboard for certain post types.

# How to Install the Plugins

## Via the Dashboard

1. Zip the directory with the plugin  you need.
2. > Plugins > New
3. Select upload
4. Choose your zip file

## Via File Transfer

Copy the directory with the plugin you want to:

~~~~
yourWordPress/wp-content/plugins
~~~~

Here you can use whatever ftp client you fancy, e.g. Filezilla, Cyberduck, ftp from the bash prompt etc.
